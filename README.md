## Customization

You can easily customize the gallery by following these steps:

1.  **Add Your Own Images**:
    -   Place your image files (e.g., in `.jpeg`, `.png` format) into the project folder.
    -   In `index.html`, add or modify the `<a>` and `<img>` tags inside the `<div class="gallery">` container.
    -   Update the `href` attribute to point to the full-resolution image and the `src` attribute to the thumbnail.
    -   Change the `data-title` attribute to set the caption for each image.

    Example:
    ```html
    <a href="path/to/your-large-image.jpg" data-lightbox="models" data-title="Your Image Caption">
        <img src="path/to/your-thumbnail.jpg">
    </a>
    ```

2.  **Change Styles**:
    -   Modify the `style.css` file to change colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements.
    -   The `lightbox.css` file contains the styles for the lightbox itself, which you can also customize if needed.
